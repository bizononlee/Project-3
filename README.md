Hello! 

If you would like to run the CelebriGator program, MAKE SURE YOU: 

-change the filepath utilized by the inFile object that is utilized in the Graph constructor (in Graph.cpp). 

-simple alteration of the string literal in line 20 of Graph.cpp to a relative/explicit filepath
which follows C++/your OS' conventions for your local location of graph.csv

-note that graph.csv is the only external data file required for the CelebriGator program to run successfully

Thanks,
