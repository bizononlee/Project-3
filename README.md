Hello! <br />

We hope you enjoy reading our report on CelebriGator as much as we enjoyed completing this project!<br />

If you would like to run the CelebriGator program, MAKE SURE YOU: 

&emsp;-change the filepath utilized by the inFile object that is utilized in the Graph constructor (in Graph.cpp) 

&emsp;-simple alteration of the string literal in line 20 of Graph.cpp to a relative/absolute filepath <br />
&emsp;which follows C++/your OS' conventions for your local location of graph.csv

&emsp;-note that graph.csv is the only external data file required for the CelebriGator program to run successfully<br />
  
Thank you for an intriguing and educational semester!<br />

Thanks,<br />
